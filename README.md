 Project #1: The Game Tic Tac Toe

### Overview

The theme of my Tic-Tac-Toe game is construction site and vehicles.
I wanted to theme to be something that my son would love and get excited about.
I imagine sharing it with him once it's finished

### Technical Requirements

My game does the following:

* **Render's a game in the browser**
* **Switch's turns**
* **Design logic for winning**
* **visually display which player won or if it is a tie**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**

<!-- ### Bonus extensions

These are for extra credit! DON'T focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* Allow game customizable options, time limits, board size, game rounds, name & profiles etc  
* Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
* Get inventive with your styling - research CSS effects, animations to spiff things up
* **Research** **LocalStorage** or **SessionStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
* **Research** web audio API and add sound effects to your game
* Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist! -->
