# Tic Tac Truck
### Instructions
Tic Tac Truck
* Digger and Tools are used to differentiate between players instead of 'x' and 'o' markers.
* Players take turns making moves on the 3x3 square grid.

### Overview
The theme of my Tic-Tac-Toe game is construction site and vehicles.
I wanted to theme to be something that my son would love and get excited about.
I imagine sharing it with him once it's finished

### Challenges
Working out the win logic was way more complex than I first thought. I needed to break everything down into smaller steps.
* Take user input
* Check if the clicked position on the board had already been selected
* Outputting changes to the grid by manipulating DOM elements
* Switching between players & keeping track of each player's move
* Checking for a win or draw after each move

### Future Development
I would like to return to this project and introduce:
* Resetting the player scores
* Switching the start player
* Increase the game board size to be large then 3x3
* Remove alerts and display colour and text for the winning player
* Add other themes
